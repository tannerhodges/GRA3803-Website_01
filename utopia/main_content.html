    <p>There's big news at OrganicUtopia this month! We've expanded to include 2 new lines of body and earth-friendly products. We now carry bio-degradeable furniture - imagine a couch you can leave on the street that will slowly decompose back into Mother Earth! We also have added recyclable shopping bags, which eliminate the need for the age-old question &quot;paper or plastic?&quot;. These bags are tough, stylish, and eco-friendly!</p>

    <p> We've got everything from healthy<a href="#"> lifestyle foods</a> and <a href="#">organic gourmet products</a> to other lifestyle products. We also have a full line of eco-friendly furniture, clothes, candles and home furnishings.</p>
