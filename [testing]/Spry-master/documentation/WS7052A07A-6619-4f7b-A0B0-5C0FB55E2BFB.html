                        Changes brought about by Web 2.0 present
a leap forward in web functionality and user experience. The bar
has officially been raised, and the rapid adoption of Ajax is proof
that "next-generation" web interfaces are in high demand. In many ways,
this trend is an "of course" moment. Of course Google Maps is the
way that mapping is supposed to work. When you first experience
it, you wonder why it took so long to be. While the underlying technologies
of Ajax have been around for a while now, the recent explosion of
Ajax-powered pages and applications has brought to light some limitations
of XHTML, browsers, assistive technologies, and standards.</p>
<p>Ajax is a great example of the natural tension that exists between
innovation (going "outside the box" to achieve better results) and
standardization (the desire to keep things orderly) because, amidst
all the excitement around Ajax, there is also a concern that things
are moving too fast and too wrecklessly. Some say that, in the rush
to adopt Ajax, developers are moving forward without regard for
the basic guidelines and standards that have been established around
web technolgies over the years. The worry is that, with Ajax, it's
too easy to end up with a more engaging web page (good) that doesn't
validate, is not accessible, and only works in modern browsers (bad).
For many, this outcome represents a step backwards.</p>
<p>This same concern was raised with regard to Spry when Adobe first
released it, and the Adobe Spry team has taken that feedback seriously.
One of our key objectives for Spry 1.6 was to develop and promote
a set of best-practices that allow developers to use Spry without
sacrificing adherence to standards. In some cases, we've actually
extended or adapted Spry itself to accomodate this goal. In other
cases, we're simply building awareness (through articles, demos
and samples) about the pros and cons of employing certain techniques
-- explaining trade-offs so that designers/developers can make well-informed
decisions about which way to go. But we're also aiming to show that,
with Spry, it doesn't have to be a trade-off. You can have your
Web 2.0 cake and eat it too. This section discusses the state of
"standards" on the web and explains how Spry can be used to produce
"next-generation" web experiences while still honoring those standards.</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Complying with standards</h4>
                        
                        <p>The goal of web
standards is admirable. If everyone writes web pages that strictly follow
a known set of rules, then pages render consistently (because browsers and
devices have a known set of markup to render) and are easy to understand, edit,
and validate . Standards keep everyone on the same page. So what
is the “standard”?</p>

                        <p>In the strictest sense, the standard is
a set of rules written by the W3C that define the scope and use
of (X)HTML tags and attributes. Over a series of years, these rules
are proposed, argued over, and ratified by this consortium. Because
no one “owns” the internet, these standards are guidelines. No one
has to follow them but, if we all did, developers would know how
to write and browsers would know how to render.</p>

                        <p>So, using
this definition, a page is “standards compliant” only if all the
tags and attributes in a page are used in a way that complies with
the rules defined for that type of page. These rules are specified
in what is known as a Document Type Definition (DTD). A DTD defines
the tag, attributes and values allowed in a particular type of page.
No custom attributes can be used and all the values used in attributes
must be valid. DTDs are discussed in more detail below.</p>

                        <p>There
are, of course, broader interpretations of what it means to be standards compliant.
For example, some would extend the standards umbrella to include the
use of semantic, accessible, and well-formed mark-up. </p>

                     </div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">DTDs and page validation</h4>
                        
                        <p>A valid document
is one that follows all the rules of the DTD. As mentioned above,
a DTD is a document that outlines a set of rules for how tags and
attributes can be used in a page. While no fun to read, you can
see one here: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>By
including a DTD reference (like the link above) at the top of your
page you are declaring that the mark-up in your page is meant to
follow all the rules defined in that DTD.</p>

                        <p>To validate a page,
you must run it through a validator, which is an application that
reads and understands the DTD rules. This application reads your
page and compares it to the DTD rules. It ensures that the page
is coded correctly according to the DTD defined on the page. Validation
errors are flagged in the validation report. While there is more
than one way to validate a document, “passing validation” is generally
accepted to mean that it passes the W3C validator. The W3C validator
will check the page or code provided and validate it against the
DTD.</p>

                        <p>Most pages on the web reference the DTDs at the W3C,
like the links above. The W3C validator will pass the page or provide
a list of how the page fails and give rules on correct code.</p>

                        <p>An
important thing to know about validation is this: Validation ONLY
says whether the page uses tags and attributes correctly as determined
by the DTD on the page. It has nothing to do with how the page renders
in the browser or functions as a web application.</p>

                     </div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">DTDs and the browser</h4>
                        
                        <p>Browsers do not actually
read DTDs when rendering a page. Browsers only do one thing with
a DTD: they use it to determine the rendering mode. All browsers have
2 rendering modes: Standards and Quirks. “Standards mode” renders
more strictly to the standard. “Quirks mode” emulates the rendering
of older versions of browser so that older existing code will not
break. If there is no DTD, the browser will render in Quirks mode.
Having a DTD at the top of the page will enable Standards mode.
To make the distinction: the browsers read the DTD url. They do
not read the actual DTD file.</p>

                        <p>It is possible to write custom
DTDs. For example, the language of mathematics has many unique ideas
and formulas. A set of math-specific tags and attributes have been
developed to extend the functionality of math within browsers, called MathML.
A DTD for these math rules has been created.</p>

                        <p>Check the source
code of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/12/09-rdf-docs/xhtml-math-svg-rdf-CC-flat.xhtml" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/2002/12/09-rdf-docs/xhtml-math-svg-rdf-CC-flat.xhtml</a>.
You will notice a series of these math tags. The DTD describes how
these tags are used and the DTD is referenced at the top of the document.</p>

                        <p>Using
this custom DTD is “extending” the DTD. This extension is perfectly
legal in XHTML. Recall that the 'X' in XHTML stands for “extensible,”
meaning that XHTML is designed to be flexible so that people can
extend the language as needed. This custom DTD referenced above
is only used to ensure that the page validates correctly. This DTD
and the validation doesn't have anything to with page functionality.</p>

                        <p>The
argument goes that since extending the DTD is legal, it is therefore
within the bounds of XHTML. But the custom nature of extending DTDs
breaks a fundamental idea of standards: using a common set of tags
and attributes to ensure consistent functionality.</p>

                     </div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">DTDs and Spry</h4>
                        
                        <p>Spry uses namespaced attributes
to specify how dynamic regions should be processed at run-time.
The Spry team chose to promote the use of namespaced attributes
for ease of use. Attributes enabled users to attach complicated
Ajax functionality to HTML code using a familiar, declarative coding
convention. Other declarative approaches were considered but discarded
due to browser limitations.</p>

                        <p>Using namespaced attributes, however,
leads to problems with page validation. Spry attributes are not
in the standard DTD used on web pages and therefore, the W3C validator
will return warnings about these attributes. According to the rules of
XHTML, these can be solved by writing and including a custom DTD.
We note these custom attributes in the Spry DTD. But, there is some
browser trouble with this technique. The validator validates, but
the browser chokes on the DTD line and displays part of it in the
window. The ins and outs are described in <a href="WS56A0E49C-7801-43bb-B0B1-1DDCE23322BA.html">Validating Spry pages</a>.</p>

                        <p>A custom DTD, while technically correct, is
not practical. If page validation is a must have for you (or your
client), however, or you simply don't like the idea of having Spry
attributes in your code, then the best solution is to use a technique we're
calling "Unobtrusive Spry" (based directly on the concept of unobtrusive JavaScript).
This is a methodology that calls for segregating all behavioral
code (generally this means JavaScript, but for Spry it also means
Spry attributes) into an external file. With this technique, no
Spry attributes are needed in your code—instead they are attached
programmatically by JavaScript when the page is loaded. To learn
more about this technique, and about other ways that Spry can help
with keeping behavior separated from structure/content, read <a href="WS03C47BEC-DDCA-42c8-B243-0BE6CE0F6CF5.html">Separating behavior from structure</a>.</p>

                     </div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Accessibility</h4>
                        
                        <p>Accessibility in the web
world means that your page can be understood by those with a range
of physical disabilities. For instance, screen readers can read
your page; the colors chosen for the page are of a contrast so that
those with limited vision can read them; alt text is provided for
all contextual images; captions and labels are used correctly.</p>

                        <p>Some
web sites by law have to be accessible. Government web sites for
instance, generally have to make their content accessible to all
viewers. There is a strict set of laws and guidelines that must
be followed. In the US, this is known as "Section 508" which is
the part of the law that denotes the rules for accessibility. With
such sites, it might be impossible to use Spry Data due to javascript
degradation and accessibility issues, but the sites might well be
able to use Spry Widgets. The appropriateness of different development
techniques depends on the context.</p>

                        <p>Spry supports accessibility
by providing keyboard navigation for all of its widgets. For instance,
we use tabindex on things like accordion tabs for tabbing between
elements. While these kinds of attributes aren't allowed on non-form elements
according to the W3C, they are supported in Mozilla and IE browsers. The
Spry team felt that providing this functionality via tabindex was
more important than the validation aspect, so we included them by
default. But the attributes are not required for functionality and
can be removed because we’ve also made it possible to use &lt;a&gt;
tags for tabbing.</p>

                     </div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Semantic Markup</h4>
                        
                        <p>Semantic Markup is the
idea of using tags and attributes correctly. If you are writing
a header, don't style a SPAN to be bigger; use an H1-6 tag correctly.
Use TH tags for table headers. Following such guidelines is beneficial
for a number reasons: HTML is used in the manner in which is was
designed; screen readers and other devices can understand how to
interpret the code correctly; and developers can also read and understand
more easily.</p>

                        <p>The Spry Accordion widget is one example that
illustrates semantic markup. By default we use a DIV for the tab
and for the content. We do this for flexibility and to show general
structure. A feature of Spry widgets is that nearly any code can be
used for the structure. So if it would be more semantic to use a
H1-6 tag for the tabs and a DIV for the content, you can do that.
For an example, see this <a href="https://github.com/adobe/Spry/tree/master/samples/accordion/AccordionSample.html#UsingOtherBlockElements" target="_blank">accordion samples page</a>.</p>

                     </div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Progressive enhancement</h4>
                        
                        <p>Progressive enhancement
is a technique for developing web pages that automatically adapt
to the browsing environment to provide a better user experience
when viewed in advanced browsers or other devices. The idea is that you
start with a basic HTML-only page. Then the page is enhanced by
adding CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and so forth, as desired, all the
while, ensuring that the page is functional and readable with these
other technologies turned off. Don't make the only navigagion bar
in Flash because you can't assume that all your readers have Flash
Player. For more information, see <a href="WS5A44A1B7-6D94-43a8-8CC4-22806438B31C.html">Progressive enhancement with Spry</a>.</p>

                     </div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Standards versus innovation</h4>
                        
                        <p>The rapid
adoption of Ajax has made some of the limitations of current technologies
more apparent. How do we keep innovation relevant yet still ensure
that our pages will work as expected?</p>

                        <p>There are as many techniques
for web development as there are web developers and the needs and
abilities of sites vary widely.</p>

                        <p>The web standards movement
in many ways developed from the browser wars and the lunacy of trying
to code for multiple browsers, or even multiple versions of a single
browser. If we stick to the rules of the road, everything should
work and we would, as a community, exert pressure on browser makers
to raise their bar. All web developers know how much easier their
jobs would be if the code all rendered correctly on all browsers!</p>

                        <p>As
a member of the web community, you should adhere to standards as
much as possible. Standards ensure that pages will work in a consistent
manner. Avoiding things like browser hacks will give pages longevity
as browsers progress. It will also help force the browser authors
to conform to standards.</p>

                        <p>But the web is a big place, and there
are those who don't worry about standards; there are some who want
to push the envelope, innovating and creating new things, new techniques
and tomorrows.</p>

                        <p>Ajax is popular because it works, and, when
used smartly, clearly enhances the user experience. With Spry, we
are hoping to provide a lower barrier to entry for Ajax and the
creation of next-generation web experiences. Ajax and Web 2.0 might
not be for everyone.</p>

                        <p>The good news is that you don’t have
to make an either/or decision between writing basic pages that follow
standards or writing Web 2.0 pages that abandon standards. It's
possible to have it both ways: you can use Spry, or other frameworks/widgets/techniques
in a smart, semantic, unobtrusive, progressively enhanced manner
and at the same time provide advanced functionality in a way that
works for all users, browsers, and devices.</p>
